    <h1>About me:</h1>
    <p>My name is Brad Chapin, and I'm a web developer.</p>
    <p>I graduated from the Galvanize Boulder web development immersive in 2017 (G36 for any of you other G-schoolers), and I am currently looking for my first professional role as a developer.</p>
    <p>I have a strong passion for games and game development, and ultimately, I would love to find a role in a game company, helping put out awesome games. Beyond that, I have over twenty years of customer service experience over a broad array of industries, so I feel that I have a pretty good grip on what end users want out of their products.</p>
    <p>I find that one of the best ways to learn is to teach, so if you're reading this, and thinking, "Hey, I'd like to learn to code!" then please, by all means, reach out to me; I'll share what I know, help look for what I don't, and we can learn together.</p>
    <h1>Happy Coding.</h1>
